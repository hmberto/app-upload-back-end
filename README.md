# Upload App â€” Back-end
### You can also access the Front-end of the application by [clicking here](https://github.com/hmberto/app-upload-front-end).

### React App: An image upload interface. Node.JS v14.4.0.

## How it Works
First of all, using NodeJs v14.4.0 run **npm install** to install dependencies. Now navigate to the root and then update the **.env** file. 

We used a non-relational mongoDB Atlas database in the project. it's online and free. After opening an account you can create a new Cluster and complement it in the file as shown below.
~~~
USER_DB=user1
PASS_DB=passw0rd
CLUSTER_DB=cluster0
DB_NAME=teste

APP_URL=http://192.168.15.9:3000
~~~
Add the correct domain of your environment in which it is running in **APP_URL** to the **.env** file.

You can now start your application using **npm start**. After that it will be able to perform GET, POST and DELETE requests in the **/posts** route.

## Resources
- POST requests to send a file;
- GET requests when accessing the front-end app to load previously uploaded files;
- DELETE requests by passing the image ID to delete from the database;

## Important
By default the Back-end only accepts **image files** with a maximum size of **2MB**. If you want to change it you can follow the steps:

- Navigate to **/src/config** and change the **multer.js** file.

### Default (2MB):
~~~
limits: {
  fileSize: 2*1024*1024,
},
~~~

### You can increase to as much as you want (5MB):
~~~
limits: {
  fileSize: 5*1024*1024,
},
~~~

To change the type of file that can be received:
~~~
const allowedMimes = [
  'image/jpeg',
  'image/pjpeg',
  'image/png',
  'image/gif'
]
~~~
You can choose to receive the files you want.

All uploaded files will be stored in /tmp/uploads. Data such as name, size, id and URL are stored in an online non-relational database. We used mongoDB Atlas for this project. You can create an account by clicking [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_brazil_search_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=1718986516&gclid=Cj0KCQiAnb79BRDgARIsAOVbhRqBjxkOBg4EdNCLjgq9YZBCbDJn_CfVEjRG3iGpANhPi8cXRhK0HPUaAvwvEALw_wcB). After that create a new Cluster and then add the connection data in the **.env** file in the application's root directory.
